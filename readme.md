### Repo for SQLAlchemy and Flask examples

You can refer it for understanding:
1. Relationships between tables in database schema - `Many-to-Many`, `One-to-Many`, `One-to-One`
2. Inserting data when tables exhibit different kinds of relationships.
3. Querying from tables using- `join()`,`filter()`, `ilike()` methods

For the flask movie example-
I have put all the models related code in `models.py` and APIs are written in the `app.py` file.
